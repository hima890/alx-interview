# Lockboxes Problem

## Description

This project implements a Python solution to the "Lockboxes" problem. In this problem, you are given `n` locked boxes numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Each box contains keys to other boxes. Your task is to determine if you can unlock all the boxes starting from box 0, which is always unlocked.

## Function

### `def canUnlockAll(boxes):`

This function checks whether all the boxes can be unlocked.

- **Parameters**:
  - `boxes`: A list of lists. Each list represents a box and contains integers representing keys to other boxes.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - `True` if all the boxes can be unlocked, otherwise `False`.

### Constraints:

- A key with the same number as a box can open that box.
- You start with box `0` unlocked.
- A box may contain keys to the same or different boxes.
- Some keys might not correspond to any box, and some boxes might not have any keys.
- There will be no duplicate keys inside any box.

### Example Usage

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = __import__('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False
```

### How It Works:

- You begin with the first box (box 0) unlocked.
- From there, you collect keys to other boxes.
- For each key you collect, you attempt to unlock the corresponding box.
- The process continues until you either unlock all the boxes or run out of keys.

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- All Python files must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
- All Python scripts must be executable.
- Your Python scripts must have the shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project.

## Installation

To use the function in your project:

1. Clone the repository or download the `0-lockboxes.py` file.
2. Import the `canUnlockAll` function into your Python script.
3. Use the function as shown in the example to check if all boxes can be unlocked.

## File Structure

- `0-lockboxes.py`: Contains the `canUnlockAll` function.
- `main_0.py`: Example script to demonstrate the usage of the `canUnlockAll` function.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and usage details.

## Testing

You can run the example provided in `main_0.py` or create your own test cases to ensure that the function works as expected.

### Example:

```bash
$ ./main_0.py
True
True
False
```
